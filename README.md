Solar Power Forecasting
Precise solar and wind power predictions for efficient trading and secure grid operations. Precise forecasting of solar energy is important for photovoltaic (PV) based energy plants to facilitate early participation in energy auction markets and efficient resource planning
Reliable and precise forecasting plays an important role in enhancing power plant generation based on renewable energy sources such as water, wind, and sun [9]. One of the most sustainable and competitive renewable energy sources is solar photovoltaic (PV) energy which is becoming nowadays more attracting than ever before [3]. The main crucial and challenging issue in solar energy production is the volatility intermittent of PV system power generation due to mainly to weather conditions. In particular, a variation of the temperature and irradiance can have a profound impact on the quality of electric power production. 
Hence, accurately forecasting the power output of PV modules in a short-term is of great importance for daily/hourly efficient management of power grid production, delivery, and storage, as well as for decision-making on the energy market

predict the generation of the solar plant for future time blocks based on forecasted weather parameters like Irradiance, ambient temperature, humidity, wind speed and other relevant parameters.
Dataset:
Generation dataset and one sensor readings dataset
The power generation datasets are gathered at the inverter level - each inverter has multiple lines of solar panels attached to it.
Generation Data: It has 4 columns namely:
DATE_TIME	15 minute timestamp
